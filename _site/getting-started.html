<h3 id="baby-microservice">Baby Microservice</h3>

<p>Assume that we only have two services that will communicate with each other. Suppose that each of these services (aka Node modules) have another API exposed two end users. That is not our business at the moment, since as mentioned before, XYZ will divide the matter of end user and the matter of system. Now, our goal is to focus on what is important to our own system.</p>

<p>The – dummy services are as follows:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// math.ms.js
// a very fancy math module with super fast calculation
function add(x, y) {
return x + y
}

function mul(x, y) {
  return x * y
}

// string.ms.js
// some ultra hard string manipulations
function up(str) {
  return s.toUpperCase()
}
function down(str) {
  return s.toLowerCase()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, assume that these services need to call each other in order to share their services. This is the first place that XYZ will come to action.</p>

<p>In order to have two xyz instances communicate with each other, they need to have a system, a shared system. Information about the system is filled to the xyz instance using a config parameter. The config parameter has information such as local port/it/serviceName and a list of nodes who live inside the system. Note that a node can join the system without being in the static list, this is just a basic example!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// math.ms.js
// a very fancy math module with super fast calculation
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let mathMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    name: 'MathMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3333
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: [{
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        port: 3334
      }]
  }
})

// expose these function over the system
mathMS.register('mul', (payload, response) =&gt; {
  response.send(payload.x * payload.y)
})

// expose these function over the system
mathMS.register('add', (payload, response) =&gt; {
  response.send(payload.x + payload.y)
})

// string.ms.js
// some ultra hard string manipulations
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let stringMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    name: 'stringMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3334
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: [{
        host: '127.0.0.1',
        port: 3333
      }]
  }
})

stringMS.register('up', (payload, response) =&gt; {
  response.send(payload.toUpperCase())
})
stringMS.register('down', (payload, response) =&gt; {
  response.send(payload.toLowerCase())
})
</code></pre>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire process of initializing a system and passing all of the parameters seems too much of a duplicate. We agree! check out the best practices section#common.js</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that’s it! Now, our services are virtually binded to one another and they can call the service that each of them exposed using <code class="highlighter-rouge">.register</code>. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">microservices: [...]</code> key in <strong>systemConf</strong> will declare the list of other nodes that we can connect to. Obviously, they can be local or remote IPs.</p>

<h4 id="a-note-on-terminology">A Note on terminology.</h4>

<p>Words and phrases in XYZ system are explained in Wiki page. Just to recap, each function exposed via <code class="highlighter-rouge">.register</code> is a <em>service</em>.<br />
Each <strong>Node Process</strong>, having a number of services is called a <strong>node</strong> (or in some places a <em>microservice</em>, but its just temporary).</p>

<p>Back to our little system. Now, one of these system can call a service in the other system using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.call</code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>//stringMS
// note that these callback styles are inherited from node's native http module.
// `resp` is the IncomingMessage instance etc.
// https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage

stringMS.call('mul', {x: 2, y:5}, (err, body, res) =&gt; {
  console.log(`my fellow service responded with ${body}`)
})
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should now see an output like:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">my fellow service responded with 10</code></p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>In this example we hardcoded the list of service, so that they can communicate with each other. This is… just about ok. It is not awesome. What would be awesome is to have nodes joining the system dynamically. Yes, that’s what we’re going to do in the Next Section.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="replicating-your-nodes-and-services">Replicating Your Nodes and Services</h1>

<p>It would have been much more interesting, if we could add nodes dynamically. Good news: we can.</p>

<p>XYZ nodes can join a system, given that they have a [list of] seed node(s). Seed nodes are the entry point to the system. They should check the authority of the incoming node, if required, and pass the list of nodes available inside the system to it, or any other authentication certificate, again, if required. The fact that there are a lots of ‘ <em>if required</em> ‘ phrases in the statement is that all of these steps are optional and the developer can choose to have them. In the most _Wildcard_is scenario, all nodes are public and anyone can join them.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that both the <em>StringMS</em> and <em>MathMS</em> in the previous section do not know each other. That is to say, their list of microservice/nodes in <em>systemConf</em> is empty:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// string.ms.js
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let stringMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    name: 'stringMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3334
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: []
  }
})

// math.ms.js
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let mathMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    name: 'MathMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3333
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: []
  }
})
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Furthermore, let’s assume that the MathMS is the constant node in the system and stringMSs are going to come and go. Go ahead and run the mathMS alone, you will see that nothing happens.</p>

<p>Now run the stringMS. you’ll se that:<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">warn :: Sending a message to /mul from first find strategy failed (Local Response)  
my fellow service responded with null</code></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz.service.send.first.find">first find strategy</a> is a default behavior embedded inside node XYZ for finding nodes to send messages to. We’ll see more on this later. The main point is that the message failed. Obviously because StringMS does not know any mathMS at this point!</p>

<p>Change the stringMS to the following, specifying a new seed node for it. Also add a filed in mathMS that will indicate that this node is allowed to admit new nodes:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// string.ms.js
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let stringMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    name: 'stringMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3334,
    seed: [{host: '127.0.0.1', port: 3333}]
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: []
  }
})

// math.ms.js
let xyz = require('xyz-core').xyz
let mathMS = new xyz({
  selfConf: {
    allowJoin: true,
    name: 'MathMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3333
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: []
  }
})
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, the two nodes have no knowledge of each other, yet they can join and work with each other. Go ahead and run the MathMS, next run the stringMS in a separate terminal and see the results. As you see, the output is still the same.</p>

<p>This get’s even more interesting when we add more nodes. You can add more stringMS nodes and see that all of them will eventually find the MathMS and can connect with them. There is only one small problem. All stringMSs are configured to use one port. Hopefully, XYZ provides a way to override any configuration, for debugging purposes mainly. We’ll cover this later, but, for now, you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">--xyzport</code> command line argument to override the port. Run many many more StringMS instances with:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ node math.ms.js --xyzport 5000
$ node math.ms.js --xyzport 5001
$ node math.ms.js --xyzport 5002
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you are more interested to see how nodes actually work with each other, see the ()[Service Discovery and Ping] section.</p>

<p>A question might come to mind at this point. We have many sender nodes, and only just one receiver node in this example, so… it is kind obvious how each request gets routed. Assume that we have two receiver nodes (mathMS) and a dozen sender nodes, how could we decide on one of the mathMSs?</p>

<p>You might argue that this is a matter that xyz should handle. Indeed, we do handle it. it’s just that we are very keen to make you familiarized whit what’s happening under the hood, so that you can change it when required.</p>

<p>In order to have different message routing ways, xyz supports to mechanisms:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Service Discovery middlewares</li>
  <li>Path based service identification</li>
</ol>

<p>The upcoming sections will describe these concepts.</p>

<p>Before going into the next section, you might argue that why is this so important? In a microservice-based system, it is crucially important!</p>

<p>If you think about the system as a whole, you come to realize that many many types of messages might be sent. One node might want to broadcast a message to <strong>all other nodes</strong>, or to a subset of them. A node might want to apprise just a few database nodes about a record update, and many many more events that might happen!</p>

<p>If you are not convinced about this, I highly recommend you to read the <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz-core/wiki/">Wiki</a> page of xyz-core, specially the one about <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz-core/wiki/Microservices%3F-What%3F">microservices</a>.</p>

<h1 id="service-discovery">Service Discovery</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the process of choosing a destination node when making a call is rather difficult and obscure. XYZ provides a configuration for each of the nodes, so that each node can actually choose a strategy for sending a message.</p>

<p>The good thing about these plugins is that they are completely free to modifiable. That is to say, you can write your own strategy and patch it into your system!</p>

<p>XYZ currently has two trivial approaches implemented as plugins. Let’s look at one of them <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz.service.send.first.find/blob/master/call.middleware.first.find.js">here</a> :</p>

</div>

<p>We really don’t want to go too deep inside this code at the time, but you can get a general feeling about it that a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Path</code> object will eventually find a list of nodes that can response to a certain <code class="highlighter-rouge">servicePath</code> and calls the first one:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transportClient.send(matches[0], node , userPayload, responseCallback)</code>.</p>

<p>whenever you call <code class="highlighter-rouge">someMs.call('foo' , ()=&gt;{} )</code> in your code, somewhere along the path, this function will be called and it will find one destination node and invokes a transport client with it. Transport client is the actual module that will make the HTTP/TCP call to destination node.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This structure, a function with parameters passed as array, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">done</code> callbacks is actually the <strong>middleware</strong> signature of XYZ. We’ll learn soon about middleware in this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change your string ms to call an invalid service, say, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.call('blahblah', () =&gt; {})</code>. Now look at the warning logs. Now look at the end of this plugin :
<code class="highlighter-rouge">logger.warn("Sending a message to ${servicePath} from first find strategy failed (Local Response)")</code>
Are you seeing what I am seeing too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>XYZ is configured to work with this module by default. if you wish to change them, a new key named <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">defaultSendStrategy</code></strong> should be added to the configuration object passed to xyz constructor.</p>

<p>In order to test this feature, let’s use another send strategy, <strong>send.to.all</strong>. You can find the plugin <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz.service.send.to.all">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, include this plugin inside your working directory:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install xyz.service.send.to.all
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, we are going to run three math services, and a dozen of string services. The configurations are similar to the previous section. We only have to configure string.ms to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">xyz.service.send.to.all</code> :</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>// math.ms.js
// same as before


// string.ms.js
let sendToAll = require('xyz.service.send.to.all')

let stringMS = new xyz({
  defaultSendStrategy: sendToAll,
  selfConf: {
    name: 'stringMS',
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 3334,
    seed: [{host: '127.0.0.1', port: 3333}]
  },
  systemConf: {
    microservices: []
  }
})

...

// our responses are going to be from few possible nodes, hence they are objects from now on!
// use JSON.stringify instead.
setInterval(() =&gt; {
  stringMS.call('mul', {x: 2, y: 5}, (err, body, res) =&gt; {
    console.log(`my fellow service responded with ${JSON.stringify(body)}`)
  })
}, 2000)

</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Fisrt, run the math ms and string ms like before. The string ms will join the math ms. First point is that now, our responses are different, it has been indicated the this values has been responded form which node.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>my fellow service responded with {"127.0.0.1:3333:/mul":[null,10]}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>in each array response, the first index is the error and the second one is the actual response.</p>

<p>Now go ahead and run a new math.ms. An old response happens here again. We need the new instance of Math ms to have a seed node, yet, we didn’t include it in it’s configuration.</p>

<p>Similar to how we can override the port number, a single seed node can also be added by command line argument. Run the new math Ms :</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>node math.ms.js --xyzport 5000 --xyzseed "127.0.0.1:3333"
node math.ms.js --xyzport 5001 --xyzseed "127.0.0.1:3333"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>after just a few seconds, the log of string ms should change to</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>my fellow service responded with {
    "127.0.0.1:3333:/mul":[null,10],
    "127.0.0.1:5000:/mul":[null,10],
    "127.0.0.1:5001:/mul":[null,10]
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In fact, if you close one of the mathMSs, you’ll see the response to be:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>my fellow service responded with {
  "127.0.0.1:5001:/mul":[
    {"code":"ECONNREFUSED","errno":"ECONNREFUSED","syscall":"connect","address":"127.0.0.1","port":5001},
    null
  ],
  "127.0.0.1:3333:/mul":[null,10],
  "127.0.0.1:5000:/mul":[null,10]}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you see, the first parameter is the error and the second parameter is the response. This happens because each node will not immediately assume that another node is offline after one failure. The process and parameters of node failure will be discussed later.</p>

<p>So … are you not liking the way that send to all is functioning? I mean, who would respond with an array like that? This is actually what we hoped for!  this plugin is just a test plugin that we used in our development. You can easily change it to whatever you like.</p>

<p>For example, you can modify <a href="https://github.com/node-xyz/xyz.service.send.to.all/blob/master/call.send.to.all.js#L31">this line</a> to get rid of the annoying error.</p>

<p>Another interesting send strategy that you might want to implement and test is majority function. You can change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">send.to.all</code> in a way that it will send the message to all nodes, will wait for all responses, and will return with a single result, if all if the responses from different services were the same. If not, it will return an Error. Who knows, maybe you actually use this Microservice to do floating point calculations. Each machine handles floating point differently and the responses might actually differ!</p>

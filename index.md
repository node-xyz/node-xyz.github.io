## Node XYZ

Node XYZ is a NodeJS toolkit for creating microservice based distributed applications. It helps you:

  - Write microservices without worrying about all of the process communication overhead. Focus only on your business logic.
  - Dynamically join/remove nodes to your cluster of microservices.
  - Customize your system as much as possible. Authentication, logging, preprocess and post-processes are all possible via middlewares.
  - Deploy services --on the fly-- with structured path based identifier and call them within your service with different strategies.

    npm install xyz-core
